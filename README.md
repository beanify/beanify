Beanify is an improvement from [Hemera](https://github.com/hemerajs/hemera). First, it improves the microservice registration logic of the __add__ function in Hemera, allowing you to register your microservices in any [beanifyPlugin](https://github.com/beanjs-framework/beanify-plugin), rather than after the ready function is penalized. Secondly, more [lifecycle Hook](./docs/lifecycle-hook.md) functions are provided, allowing you to be more involved in routing registration, service processing, service usage, and so on. Finally, with a more plug-in development approach, deep integration with the [AVVIO](https://github.com/mcollina/avvio) framework, all plug-ins, all services are plug-in
